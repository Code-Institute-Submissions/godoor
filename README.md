# '/get-to-the-door' JavaScript game
Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute project

This is a simply browser JavaScript game. It is reflex game designed for the user to have fun.

## UX
 
This game is designed to anyone who doesn't wish to install anything on the PC/phone, just to have a quick relax (I use it in public transportation). There is plenty of room for future updates.

## Testing

I am trying to keep the game as simple as possible but fun and engaging at the same time.

I have tested the website content on various devices and browsers (IE, Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to see how it actually looks like and makingsure that all the features available on desktop are properly presented on smaller screens.

I have removed the option to highlight anything with a mouse (-webkit-user-select: none;) as it was causing issues with internet explorer and was confusing when accidentally highlighted the game title.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/geoeskel/UCFD-Milestone-Project.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.
