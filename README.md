# /godoor JavaScript game
Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute project

It is browser game designed for testing user's reflexes while keeping them entertained. The increase in speed after reaching the door provides with a steady challenge and keeps the user hooked in. Lets see how fast their fingers really are!

## UX 
This game is designed to anyone who doesn't wish to install anything on the PC/phone, just to have a quick relax (I use it in public transportation). There is plenty of room for future updates.

## User stories
1. First Time Visitor Goals
 - As a first time visitor, I like the fact that I don't have to install anything to play.
 - As a first time visitor, I would like 'my' square to move backwards and vertically.
 - As a first time visitor, I like the progressive challange increase

2. Returning Visitors Goals
 - As a returning visitor, I would like to beat my previous high score
 - As a returning visitor, I would like to see a high score wall
 
3. Frequent Visitor Goals
 - As a frequest visitor, I would like to see if there are any new updates and features
 
## Design

1. Colour Scheme
 - The three main colours used are gray, blue and gold.
 
2. Typography
 - The Black Ops One font is the main font used throughout the whole project. Black Ops One is an old-school gaming looking font and work good with the game's design; it is both attractive and appropriate.

3. Imagery 
 - The background's colours work well with the rest of the design and allow for a good colour contrast. The background adds a modern, aesthetic look.

## Testing

I am trying to keep the game as simple as possible but fun and engaging at the same time.

I have tested the website content on various devices and browsers (IE, Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to see how it actually looks like and makingsure that all the features available on desktop are properly presented on smaller screens.

I have removed the option to highlight anything with a mouse (-webkit-user-select: none;) as it was causing issues with internet explorer and was confusing when accidentally highlighted the game title.
