# '/get-to-the-door' JavaScript game
Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute project

It is browser game designed for testing user's reflexes while keeping them entertained. The increase in speed after reaching the door provides with a steady challenge and keeps the user hooked in. Lets see how fast their fingers really are!

## UX
 
This game is designed to anyone who doesn't wish to install anything on the PC/phone, just to have a quick relax (I use it in public transportation). There is plenty of room for future updates.

## User stories
- As a player, I like the fact that I don't have to install anything to play.
- As a player, I would like 'my' square to move backwards and vertically.
- As a player, I would like the screen to fit my phone better.
- As a player, I like the speed increase 
- As a developer, I want to block the user's ability to 'break' the game
- As a developer, I want to add 'Subscribe' area so I can keep my players informed of any new features and updates

## Testing

I am trying to keep the game as simple as possible but fun and engaging at the same time.

I have tested the website content on various devices and browsers (IE, Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) to see how it actually looks like and makingsure that all the features available on desktop are properly presented on smaller screens.

I have removed the option to highlight anything with a mouse (-webkit-user-select: none;) as it was causing issues with internet explorer and was confusing when accidentally highlighted the game title.
